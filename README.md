# Front End
We used the Bootstrap toolkit to enhance the user interface of our application.
By utilizing Bootstrap's pre-built components, we were able to ensure a
consistent design across different devices and screen sizes. Among the
components used are cards, buttons and a jumbotron.
For the layout and alignments, we used Flexbox.
